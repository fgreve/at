R Markdown V2 has a lot of really, really cool features including [R Markdown Websites](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html), [Floating Table of Contents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#floating-toc), [Tabbed Sections](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#tabbed-sections), and more. It would be a good idea to explore and summarize them as well as create a section of this site to serve as an R Markdown site, as a replacement or supplement to the current system described in [R Markdown for Jekyll](/blog/2016/03/22/test.html).
