Lots of options for [this](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nhlscrapr/nhlscrapr.pdf) R package. Not very much information out there, so maybe a tutorial is appropriate. Then analysis of faceoffs (does the home team actually win more), then maybe sitting a Shiny App on top of it. The [Scientific Software Network Map Project](http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu/application/nhlscrapr/gitprojects) is really useful in tracking down supplementary materials including [this code](https://github.com/dbendet/hockey_analytics/blob/master/rink_drawing.r) to draw a hockey rink.
