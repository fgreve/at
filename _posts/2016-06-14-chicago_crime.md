Explore the Chicago Crime API and maybe sit a Shiny app on top of it. It might be fun to explore in-depth the feautres in their [crime site](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/) and their own [front-end interface](https://github.com/newsapps/chicagocrime#installing-and-using-the-front-end-app) and try to build something better. There may also be opportunity to construct a Python and/or R interface to the API to practice creating a package/module. To do so it may be helpful to take the skeleton from similar APIs for Twitter et al. which are simply a set of tools to make HTTP requests intuitive. 

Statistical exploration could include analyzing relationships between types of crimes i.e. drug-related crimes don't necessarily appear to correlate with violent crimes at the surface.

Finally, a Shiny app would be a great opportunity to publish something to [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io).
